#### Question 1 : High-Value Customers with Multiple Products
The business team wants to understand which users are engaged in both savings and investment products and how much theyâ€™ve deposited in total.
First aproah was to understand the table and each column i created an ER Diagram to have an overview on each table relationship.
#### Challenges:
To accurately identify actual deposits, I closely examined the confirmed_amount and transaction_status fields in the savings_savingsaccount table. I found that confirmed_amount reflects the amount of money deposited and not amount. Conversely, when confirmed_amount is greater than zero, the transaction_status is usually 'success' or 'reward'. Based on this, I determined that only transactions where confirmed_amount is greater than zero and success should be treated as valid deposits.
